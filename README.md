__Farmory__ is aimed at being a 2D game focused on logistics in a farm environment, drawing inspirtaion from the likes of Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley, but focusing more on interaction among crops and logistics. At the end of the day, this project's real purpose is to face the challenges of writing and working with an ECS setup.
